# CSC 380: Principles of Data Science - Spring 2022

The course introduces students to principles of data science that are necessary for computer scientists to make effective decisions in their professional careers. A number of computer science sub-disciplines now rely on data collection and analysis. For example, computer systems are now complicated enough that comparing the execution performance of two different programs becomes a statistical estimation problem rather than a deterministic computation. This course teaches students the basic principles of how to properly collect and process data sources in order to derive appropriate conclusions from them. The course has three main components: data analysis, machine learning, and a project where students apply the concepts discussed in class to a substantial open-ended problem.

Much of the course
materials will be based on the following materials (in the order of appearance
  in class schedule):

 * [Lecture notes](https://parameterfree.com/lecture-notes-on-online-learning/) by Francesco Orabona (FO).
 * [Bandit algorithms](https://tor-lattimore.com/downloads/book/book.pdf) by Tor Lattimore and Csaba Szepesvari (LS)
 * [Understanding machine learning: from theory to algorithms](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/UnderstandingMachineLearning/) by Shai Shalev-Shwartz and Shai Ben-David (SSBD)

The following set of surveys and books also provide a good coverage of relevant materials:

 * [Online learning and online convex optimization](https://www.cs.huji.ac.il/~shais/papers/OLsurvey.pdf) by Shai Shalev-Shwartz
 * [Introduction to online optimization](https://ocobook.cs.princeton.edu/OCObook.pdf) by Elad Hazan (H)
 * [Regret analysis of stochastic and nonstochastic multi-armed bandit problems](http://sbubeck.com/SurveyBCB12.pdf) by Sebastien Bubeck and Nicolo Cesa-Bianchi
 * [Introduction to Multi-Armed Bandits](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1904.07272.pdf) by Alex Slivkins
-->

Other useful resources

 * Here are some excellent notes for [probability review](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-prob.pdf) and [linear algebra review](http://cs229.stanford.edu/section/cs229-linalg.pdf).
 * You should have no difficulty in Python programming (matlab/julia allowed).
 * You may also find [The matrix cookbook](https://www.math.uwaterloo.ca/~hwolkowi/matrixcookbook.pdf), [The Probability and Statistics Cookbook](http://statistics.zone/) useful, and [Calculus cheatsheet](https://tutorial.math.lamar.edu/pdf/calculus_cheat_sheet_all.pdf).
