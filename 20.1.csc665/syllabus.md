# Syllabus of CSC 665: Online Learning and Multi-armed Bandits

### Description of Course

This course is a continuing line of topics from [CSC 665 Section 2 Machine Learning Theory](https://zcc1307.github.io/csc665/index.html) that delve into online learning and multi-armed bandits (but the knowledge from ML theory is not required).
The students will learn, via the lens of mathematical foundations, how and when machines can learn in an online manner.
Specifically, the course offers mathematical formulation of learning environments (e.g., stochastic and adversarial worlds with possibly limited feedback), fundamental limits of learning in these environments, various algorithms concerning sample efficiency, computational efficiency, and generality.
Throughout, students will not only learn fundamental mathematical tools upholding the current understanding of sequential decision making in the research community but also develop skills of adapting these techniques to their own research needs such as developing new algorithms.


### Course Prerequisites or Co-requisites

Linear Algebra or equivalent:

* You will need to understand the relationship between linear operators, linear transformations, and matrices
* We will make repeated use of matrix decompositions such as the SVD

Multivariate Calculus or equivalent:

Basic probability theory and statistics:

* You will need to understand (conditional) expectation and (conditional) independence of random variables.
* You will need to have basic concepts on concentration of measures.

<!--You will need a basic programming skills for math such as matlab, julia, or python with numpy/scipy.-->

### Course Format and Teaching Methods
Lectures, individual assignments, written exams, projects, in-class discussions.

### Course Objectives

A successful student will be able to explain the key concepts of online learning, convex optimization, and the bandit feedback, and analyze lower and upper  bounds of the achievable performance of the various online learning tasks and algorithms.
Main topics include:

* The online learning framework
* Classes of loss functions: convexity, strong convexity, exp-concavity
* Online-to-batch conversion
* Online linear optimization
* Prediction with expert advice
* Online mirror descent
* Follow the regularized leader
* Adversarial/stochastic multi-armed bandits
* Contextual bandits
* Linear bandits
* Pure exploration
* Off-policy evaluation

This course is far from a complete survey of the concurrent topics on online learning and multi-armed bandits due to the sheer volume of recent developments and the fact that those topics require a deep understanding of concepts and fluency in mathematical techniques. That said, this course covers key topics that not only serve as building blocks of online learning but is also relevant in modern research so that the students can directly adapt learned topics to their own research. Students are expected to dedicate a significant amount of time on understanding mathematical concepts and skills outside the classroom.

### Expected Learning Outcomes

The expected learning outcomes of the course is:
* To be able to understand the concept of the key performance measure called 'regret', and how online learning is able to deal with adversarial data (i.e., non-stochastic).
* To be able to list the common loss classes and their achievable regret bounds and explain why accelerated rates are available for some classes. 
* To be able to explain how online mirror descent and follow the regularized leader is different, and when one is better than the other.
* To be able to identify the key problem parameters that govern the regret rates for each problem.
* To be able to explain the key challenge in the bandit feedback.
* To be able to articulate how various bandit problems pose different challenges and what the achievable regret rates are.
* To be able to explain how the pure exploration is different from the regret minimization in multi-armed bandits.
* To be able to describe the landscape of online learning and list a few open problems researchers are currently working on.

### Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct
The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all.  We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty.  Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated.  The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site.  We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.

### Classroom Behavior Policy
To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.).
Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students.
Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom.

### Threatening Behavior Policy
The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself. See <http://policy.arizona.edu/education-and-student-affairs/threatening-behavior-students>.

### Notification of Objectionable Materials
This course will contain material of a mature nature, which may include explicit language, depictions of nudity, sexual situations, and/or violence. The instructor will provide advance notice when such materials will be used.  Students are not automatically excused from interacting with such materials, but they are encouraged to speak with the instructor to voice concerns and to provide feedback.

### Accessibility and Accommodations
At the University of Arizona we strive to make learning experiences as accessible as possible. If you anticipate or experience physical or academic barriers based on disability or pregnancy, you are welcome to let me know so that we can discuss options.  You are also encouraged to contact Disability Resources (520-621-3268) to explore reasonable accommodation.
If our class meets at a campus location: Please be aware that the accessible table and chairs in this room should remain available for students who find that standard classroom seating is not usable.

### Code of Academic Integrity
Students are encouraged to share intellectual views and discuss freely the principles and applications of course materials. However, graded work/exercises must be the product of independent effort unless otherwise instructed. Students are expected to adhere to the UA Code of Academic Integrity as described in the UA General Catalog. See <http://deanofstudents.arizona.edu/academic-integrity/students/academic-integrity>.
The University Libraries have some excellent tips for avoiding plagiarism, available at <http://new.library.arizona.edu/research/citing/plagiarism>.

### UA Nondiscrimination and Anti-harassment Policy
The University is committed to creating and maintaining an environment free of discrimination; see <http://policy.arizona.edu/human-resources/nondiscrimination-and-anti-harassment-policy>.
Our classroom is a place where everyone is encouraged to express well-formed opinions and their reasons for those opinions. We also want to create a tolerant and open environment where such opinions can be expressed without resorting to bullying or discrimination of others.
