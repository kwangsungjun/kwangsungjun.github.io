            <h1 id="syllabus-of-csc-665-online-learning-and-multi-armed-bandits">Syllabus of CSC 665: Online Learning and Multi-armed Bandits</h1>
            <h3 id="description-of-course">Description of Course</h3>
            <p>This course is a continuing line of topics from <a href="https://zcc1307.github.io/csc665/index.html">CSC 665 Section 2 Machine Learning Theory</a> that delve into online learning and multi-armed bandits (but the knowledge from ML theory is not required). The students will learn, via the lens of mathematical foundations, how and when machines can learn in an online manner. Specifically, the course offers mathematical formulation of learning environments (e.g., stochastic and adversarial worlds with possibly limited feedback), fundamental limits of learning in these environments, various algorithms concerning sample efficiency, computational efficiency, and generality. Throughout, students will not only learn fundamental mathematical tools upholding the current understanding of sequential decision making in the research community but also develop skills of adapting these techniques to their own research needs such as developing new algorithms.</p>

            <h3 id="course-objectives">Course Objectives</h3>
            <p>A successful student will be able to explain the key concepts of online learning, convex optimization, and the bandit feedback, and analyze lower and upper bounds of the achievable performance of the various online learning tasks and algorithms. Main topics include:</p>
            <ul>
            <li>The online learning framework</li>
            <li>Classes of loss functions: convexity, strong convexity, exp-concavity</li>
            <li>Online-to-batch conversion</li>
            <li>Online linear optimization</li>
            <li>Prediction with expert advice</li>
            <li>Online mirror descent</li>
            <li>Follow the regularized leader</li>
            <li>Adversarial/stochastic multi-armed bandits</li>
            <li>Contextual bandits</li>
            <li>Linear bandits</li>
            <li>Pure exploration</li>
            <li>Off-policy evaluation</li>
            </ul>
            <p>This course is far from a complete survey of the concurrent topics on online learning and multi-armed bandits due to the sheer volume of recent developments and the fact that those topics require a deep understanding of concepts and fluency in mathematical techniques. That said, this course covers key topics that not only serve as building blocks of online learning but is also relevant in modern research so that the students can directly adapt learned topics to their own research. Students are expected to dedicate a significant amount of time on understanding mathematical concepts and skills outside the classroom.</p>
            <h3 id="expected-learning-outcomes">Expected Learning Outcomes</h3>
            <p>The expected learning outcomes of the course is: * To be able to understand the concept of the key performance measure called ‘regret’, and how online learning is able to deal with adversarial data (i.e., non-stochastic). * To be able to list the common loss classes and their achievable regret bounds and explain why accelerated rates are available for some classes. * To be able to explain how online mirror descent and follow the regularized leader is different, and when one is better than the other. * To be able to identify the key problem parameters that govern the regret rates for each problem. * To be able to explain the key challenge in the bandit feedback. * To be able to articulate how various bandit problems pose different challenges and what the achievable regret rates are. * To be able to explain how the pure exploration is different from the regret minimization in multi-armed bandits. * To be able to describe the landscape of online learning and list a few open problems researchers are currently working on.</p>

            <h3 id="department-of-computer-science-code-of-conduct">Department of Computer Science Code of Conduct</h3>
            <p>The Department of Computer Science is committed to providing and maintaining a supportive educational environment for all. We strive to be welcoming and inclusive, respect privacy and confidentiality, behave respectfully and courteously, and practice intellectual honesty. Disruptive behaviors (such as physical or emotional harassment, dismissive attitudes, and abuse of department resources) will not be tolerated. The complete Code of Conduct is available on our department web site. We expect that you will adhere to this code, as well as the UA Student Code of Conduct, while you are a member of this class.</p>
            <h3 id="classroom-behavior-policy">Classroom Behavior Policy</h3>
            <p>To foster a positive learning environment, students and instructors have a shared responsibility. We want a safe, welcoming, and inclusive environment where all of us feel comfortable with each other and where we can challenge ourselves to succeed. To that end, our focus is on the tasks at hand and not on extraneous activities (e.g., texting, chatting, reading a newspaper, making phone calls, web surfing, etc.). Students are asked to refrain from disruptive conversations with people sitting around them during lecture. Students observed engaging in disruptive activity will be asked to cease this behavior. Those who continue to disrupt the class will be asked to leave lecture or discussion and may be reported to the Dean of Students. Some learning styles are best served by using personal electronics, such as laptops and iPads. These devices can be distracting to other learners. Therefore, students who prefer to use electronic devices for note-taking during lecture should use one side of the classroom.</p>
            <h3 id="threatening-behavior-policy">Threatening Behavior Policy</h3>
            <p>The UA Threatening Behavior by Students Policy prohibits threats of physical harm to any member of the University community, including to oneself.
