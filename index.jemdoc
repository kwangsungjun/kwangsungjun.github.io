I am a post-doc supervised by Professors [http://nowak.ece.wisc.edu Robert Nowak], [http://willett.ece.wisc.edu/ Rebecca Willett], and [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~swright/ Stephen Wright] at UW-Madison [https://discovery.wisc.edu/ Wisconsin Institute for Discovery] under optimization theme. 
I received my PhD in 2015 at University of Wisconsin-Madison, advised by [http://pages.cs.wisc.edu/~jerryzhu/ Xiaojin (Jerry) Zhu]. 
I obtained a B.S. in computer science with a minor in mathematics from School of Computing, Soongsil University, South Korea. 

# My research interest is mainly /(i)/ learning with limited feedback (*multi-armed bandit*); I also work on /(ii)/ machine learning for understanding humans and /(iii)/ online learning under changing environments.

My research focuses on sequential decision-making in feedback loops (i.e., the multi-aremd bandit problem).
I also work on online optimization and machine learning applied to psychology.

== Multi-Armed Bandit

Multi-armed bandit is a /state-less/ version of the reinforcement learning (RL).
However, bandits usually enjoy stronger theoretical guarantees and have abundant real-world applications.
Informally speaking, bandits learn to make better decisions over time in a feedback-loop.
The decisions necessarily affect the feedback information, and the feedback data collected so far is no longer i.i.d.; most traditional learning guarantees do not apply.

Bandits are actively being studied in both [https://arxiv.org/abs/1204.5721 theory] and [http://rob.schapire.net/papers/www10.pdf applications] including [https://mwtds.azurewebsites.net/ deployable web service]. 
Also, the cartoon caption contest of New Yorker is currently using a multi-armed bandit algorithm to efficiently crowdsource caption evaluations (read this [http://nextml.org/2015/12/04/new-yorker.html article])!

# # jemdoc: menu{MENU}{index.html}, showsource
# = jemdoc -- light markup
# [https://jemnz.com/ Jacob Mattingley] ([www@jemnz.com])
# 
# jemdoc is a light text-based markup language designed for creating 
# websites. It takes a text file written with [example.html jemdoc markup], an
# optional configuration file and an optional menu file, and makes static websites
# that look something like this one, [https://jemnz.com that one] or
# [http://www.stanford.edu/class/ee364a/ another one].
# 
# jemdoc was inspired by [http://www.methods.co.nz/asciidoc/ AsciiDoc], which is a
# text document format. AsciiDoc is great, and lots of the ideas from AsciiDoc are
# copied in jemdoc. The main differences are that jemdoc is simpler (you could say
# deliberately feature poor) and has more consistent syntax.
# 
# [download.html Download jemdoc.]
# 
# ~~~
# Version +0.7.3+ was released on 2012-11-27 with some small bug fixes.
# See the [revision.html release notes].
# ~~~
# 
# [https://github.com/jem/jemdoc Contribute to jemdoc on github.]
# 
# == Goals
# - Simple, consistent syntax.
# - $\mbox{\LaTeX}$ [latex.html equation support].
# - [tables.html Table support].
# - Portability. The (single) jemdoc [http://www.python.org/ Python] file \+
#   single css file \+ your input file {{&rarr;}} html.
# - Based on [http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/ CSS] so formatting specifics are
#   independent of jemdoc.
# - Production of clean,
#   [http://validator.w3.org/check/referer
#   standards-compliant] [http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml11/ XHTML 1.1].
# - Minimal bells and whistles, but simple fallback to raw html if required.
